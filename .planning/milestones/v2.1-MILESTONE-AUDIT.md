| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | User lands on ARCHITECTURE.md | ✓ |
| 2 | Reads platform concepts | ✓ |
| 3 | Reviews behavioral contracts | ✓ |
| 4 | Clicks "Creating Platform Adapters" link | ✓ |
| 5 | Arrives at CREATING-ADAPTERS.md | ✓ |
| 6 | Prerequisites link back to ARCHITECTURE.md | ✓ |
| 7 | Follows 5-step tutorial | ✓ |
| 8 | Uses registration checklist | ✓ |
| 9 | Runs tests per testing guide | ✓ |
| 10 | Completes Pre-PR checklist | ✓ |

**Flow Status:** ✓ Complete — No dead ends, bidirectional navigation

### Flow 2: User Support → Contributor Path

| Step | Description | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | User checks PLATFORM-SUPPORT.md | ✓ |
| 2 | Sees "Adding a New Platform" section | ✓ |
| 3 | Clicks Adapter Creation Guide link | ✓ |
| 4 | Arrives at tutorial | ✓ |

**Flow Status:** ✓ Complete

## Gaps Found

**None.** All requirements satisfied, all integrations verified.

## Tech Debt

**None.** No TODOs, stubs, or deferred items found.

## Human Verification Recommended

These items were verified programmatically but benefit from human confirmation:

### Phase 7
1. **Mermaid diagrams render on GitHub** — 3 diagrams with valid syntax
2. **Comprehension test** — Reader can explain adapter pattern after reading

### Phase 8
1. **End-to-end tutorial walkthrough** — Contributor can create working adapter
2. **Code examples accuracy** — Code compiles without modification

## Audit Result

### ✓ MILESTONE PASSED

**v2.1 Platform Documentation** has achieved its definition of done:

1. **Architecture documented** — 511 lines explaining adapter pattern, with 3 Mermaid diagrams and 10 behavioral contracts
2. **Tutorial complete** — 549 lines with 5-step guide, registration checklist, testing guide, and Pre-PR checklist
3. **Integration verified** — All cross-links work, vocabulary consistent, E2E flows complete
4. **No gaps** — All 8 requirements satisfied
5. **No tech debt** — Clean implementation

The milestone enables contributors to create new platform adapters without reverse-engineering the codebase.
